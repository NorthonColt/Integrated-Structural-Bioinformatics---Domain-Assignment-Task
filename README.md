# Integrated-Structural-Bioinformatics---Domain-Assignment-Task
This is my solution for the Domain Assignment task from the course Integrated Structural Bioinformatics.
This Python script is to identify domains of the protein with the PDB ID of 3IZP.
To use this script for other protein structures, the paths of the files, and the name of the analyzed polypeptide chain need to be customized.
